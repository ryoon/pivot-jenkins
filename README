
Jenkins

This folder contains all the (additional) stuff required by Jenkins (CI Build Services at Apache) to build Pivot.
This folder must be added to Jenkins as Source checkout, like what is done for trunk.

Note that during a Jenkins build, the environment variable jenkins.job is defined, 
so for example inside the same build files it's possible to have a different flow between standard (manual) builds, 
and automated builds by Jenkins.
